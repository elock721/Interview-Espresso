Rotate Image: Leet Code #48

Problem: 

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise)

You have to rotate the image IN PLACE (no second matrix)

ALGO/DS: Matrix - a 2 dimensional array

INPUT: Matrix nxn [][]number

OUTPUT: nothing 

EDGE CASES: na

ASSUMPTIONS: matrix will always hold numbers

GENERAL NOTES: draw out examples for matrix's, 
reverse array and flip the coordinates

PSEUDO CODE:

Reverse outer arrays
for each row ->
    * for each column
        * flip coordinates
