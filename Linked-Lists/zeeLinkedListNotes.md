Linked List Notes 

Object Oriented Programming 

Exp: A factory
    * Class produces objects 
    * In your class, design the object

Class will define properties (holds information about the object) and methods (allows interaction with the object)

Classes will also always have a constructor in JS (init in Python) -> run on creation

Linked List -> chain of nodes

A node can hold a piece of data (like a number) which is normally stored in the dot value property
