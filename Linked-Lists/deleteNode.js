Remove Nth Node: Leet Code #19

Problem: Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

ALGO/DS:

INPUT: head <ListNode 4> LL | n 1 number

OUTPUT: head <ListNode 4> LL

EDGE CASES: n = 0, delete last node | n = length - 1 delete firrst node 

ASSUMPTIONS: always at least one size 

GENERAL NOTES: practicing traversal and changing pointers 

PSEUDO CODE:

*/ 


var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    
};
